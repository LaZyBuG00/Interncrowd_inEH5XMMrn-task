#HOST A DYNAMIC WEBSITE

When a web page is
dynamic, users can
engage in interactive
user interactions. By
using a dynamic website,
you will greatly help the
goals of the businesses.
In this project, you will
host a dynamic website
on Am azon Web Services
(AWS) and use client-side
and server-side
languages such as CSS,
PHP, HTML, ASP, and
JavaScript in the website
creation process.
